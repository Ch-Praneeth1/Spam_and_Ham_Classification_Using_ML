# Spam_and_Ham_Classification_Using_ML
Spam and ham classification prediction system using ml logistic regression 


1. Importing Required Libraries: Importing necessary libraries such as Pandas for data handling, scikit-learn for machine learning operations, and matplotlib for visualization.
2. Reading the Dataset: Reading the CSV dataset containing email data into a Pandas DataFrame.
3. Data Pre-Processing: Handling null values by replacing them with an empty string.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the structure and content of the dataset, including checking for null values and examining the data types.
5. Label Encoding: Converting categorical labels (spam and ham) into numerical format (0 for spam, 1 for ham).
6. Separating Data into Features and Labels: Dividing the dataset into independent variables (message text) and dependent variable (category).
7. Visualizing the Data: Creating a bar plot to visualize the distribution of spam and ham messages in the dataset.
8. Splitting the Data: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
9. Feature Extraction: Transforming text data into numerical feature vectors using TF-IDF vectorization.
10. Creating and Training the Model: Building a Logistic Regression model and training it on the training data.
11. Model Evaluation on Training Data: Computing the accuracy of the trained model on the training dataset.
12. Model Evaluation on Testing Data: Testing the trained model on the testing dataset and computing its accuracy.
13. Prediction System: Defining a function to predict whether a given email is spam or ham based on the trained model.
14. Sample Input Text: Provided sample input texts and their corresponding categories (spam or ham) for demonstration.
Each section contributes to the overall process of building a machine learning model for spam and ham classification, including data preparation, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
